  - (I turn back, but the door to Room 203 has already closed. Through the crack
    in the door, I see the light in the room gradually dimming. Dr. Zhao's figure
    becomes more and more transparent in the darkness, like a layer of mist, slowly
    dissipating into the air. Finally, only the empty operating table and cold instruments
    remain.)
