  - That night, I sat in my dorm room all night. I kept thinking, I became a doctor
    because I wanted to save people's lives. But I didn't save anyone. I caused the
    deaths of two people. A seven-year-old child and a mother who lost her child.
    I don't deserve to be a doctor. I don't deserve to live.
